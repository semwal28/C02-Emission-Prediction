This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict the carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions of vehicles based on various features such as engine size, fuel consumption, and transmission type. The goal is to provide a predictive tool that can help understand and manage the environmental impact of different car models.

üìà Key Features
Data Analysis: Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to prepare the dataset and gain insights into vehicle-related emissions.

Model Development: Implementation and evaluation of multiple machine learning regression models.

Prediction: A trained model that can accurately predict the CO_2 emissions of new vehicles.

Data Visualization: Use of plots and charts to visualize data distributions and model performance.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

numpy for numerical operations.

scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models.

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

Model: This project utilizes regression model including Linear Regression.
